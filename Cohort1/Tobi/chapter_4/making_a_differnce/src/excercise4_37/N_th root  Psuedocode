find the nth root of a number
receive input x as the nth root of y 

divide y by 2 to check range of half the values of y 
set y/2 to i
set a counter for i number of times 
perform y modulus for the range of numbers half of y
set to new variable m
if m is equals zero 
find the power of the value that divides y without a remainder
if the result of the value raised to the power for x number of time is equal to zero 
return value;
