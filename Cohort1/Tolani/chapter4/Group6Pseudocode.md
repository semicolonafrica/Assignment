//4.20 Salary Calculator

- Get hoursworked and hoursrate
- If time is less than or equal to 40; we calculate the gross pay = hoursworked * hours rate
- If time is greater than 40, we substract the time from 40 and add the 1/2 to it, 
  we get the gross pay for extrahours and add to the gross pay for straigth hours.

//4.21 Find the Largest number.
 
- Take in series of 10 intergers
- Check largest number
- Print largest number

//4.22 Tabular Output

- Print header in tabular form
- Declare three variables
- Get numbers from 1 to 5 (counter)
- Let first variable equal number gotten * 10
- Let second variable equal number gotten * 100
- let third variable equal number gotten * 1000
- print variable in tabular form

//4.23  Find the two largest numbers

- Declare two variables to be zero, largest number and second largest number
- Take in series of 10 numbers
- Check if number is greater than greater than second largest number
- Assign largest number to be second largest number
- Assign number to be second largest number
- Check if number is greater tha largest number
- Assign number to largest number


//4.24  Validating User Input

- Check if number inputed is not equal to 1 and 2
- Display error message


//4.30  Square of Astericks

- input size of Square
- Set counter to 1
- While counter is less than or equal 1
    - Declare variable top to value of 1
    - While top less than square, print *
    - Increement top
    - Declare variable sides to be 1
    - Declare variable value to be square*2
    - While sides is less than or equal to squre
    - Declare variable f equal to square
    - While variable f less than or equal to 0
    - print * if the modulus of f and square equal to 0, sapce if not
    - Increement side
    - Decalre variable bottom to be 1
    - While bottom less than or equal to square
    - Print *
    - Increement bottom
- Increement counter.


//4.31  Palindrones

- Declare variables
- Check if input is between 10,000 and 100,000
- If input is between 10, 000 and 100,000 
- While input is greater than zero 
- Find the modulus of input and 10
- Multiply variable by 10 and add remainder
- Repeat step 5 and 6 until input is less than zero
- check if variable value is equal to the input


//4.32  Printing the Decimal Equivalent of a Binary Number

- Declare an interger number
- While number greater than zero
- Variable remainder equal number modulus ten
- Store remiander multiply counter plus decimal in variable decimal
- Counter plus equal counter
- Devide number by ten and store in variable number
- Return decimal


//4.33  Checkerboard Pattern of Asterisks

- Declare variable counter to be one
- While counter less than or equal to four
- Declare variable rows to be one
- While rows less than or equal to eight
- Print *
- Increase rows
- Print space
- Declare variable next to be one
- While next less than or equal to eight
- Print *
- Increement next


//4.34   Multiples of 2 with an Infinite Loop

- Declare variable number to be one
- Declare variable counter to be two
- While counter less than (any figure)
- Number equal number multiply by two
- Print number
- increement Counter


//4.35   Whatâ€™s Wrong with This Code?

- Declare two variable x and y
- Declare variable z
- Add x and y and assign to z
- Print increment z




Declare an interger number.
Input a binary integer.
